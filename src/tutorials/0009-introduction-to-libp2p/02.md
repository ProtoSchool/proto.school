    title: "The current problem with P2P Protocols"
    type: "multiple-choice"

P2P networks were envisioned from the very start of the internet conception as a way to create resilient networks that would function even if peers disconnected from the network due to major natural or human disasters, allowing people to continue to communicate.

P2P networks can be used for a variety of use cases, from video calls (eg Skype) to file sharing (eg Gnutella, KaZaA, eMule, and BitTorrent).

<div class="pa3 bg-near-white br2 i">
    <span class="b f5">Peer: </span>
    <span>
        A participant in a decentralised network. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application.
        In IPFS, when you load up the IPFS Desktop app in your laptop, your device becomes a peer in the decentralised network that is IPFS.
    </span>
</div>
<div class="pa3 bg-near-white br2 i">
    <span class="b f5">Peer-to-peer: </span>
    <span>
        Peer-to-peer networks are decentralised applications that share the workloads between peers. So in IPFS, each peer might contain parts or full files to be shared with other peers. If a peer requests files, any peer that has chunks of the files can participate in the sending requested files. And then, the peer who request the data can later on share the data with other peers.
    </span>
</div>

## P2P state of the art

One of the main problems with P2P connections is discoverability: how can two or more peers find each other and share information? These apps all had to solve this and more issues and each of them implemented their own solutions with different ideas and approaches.

In fact, IPFS found inspiration on the current and past state of the art to try and improve its P2P system.
There were a lot scientific papers from the academia world that provided ideas on how to solve some of these issues. Those researches had some preliminary results, so there had to be code implementations that could be used and adapted.
But the truth is that those implementations were really hard to find, or couldn't be found at all. Some of the most common situations would be:

- Lack of good documentation or none at all
- Restrictive licensing or no license to be found
- Very old code with the last update more than a decade ago
- No point of contact (no maintainer available to reach)
- Closed source (or product) or the source doesn't exist anymore
- No specification
- Implementation doesn't expose a friendly API
- Tightly coupled with a specific use
- Not upgradable with future protocols


So in the end, every time P2P protocols needed to be used, its challenges needed to be solved again and again because there was no way to re-use those software packages that implemented P2P protocols.

One would think that this was a problem of the past.
The open-source community has evolved over the years and built a robust ecosystem that provides thousands of open-source software packages that include a thorough battery of test suites, good documentation, and friendly APIs.
But unfortunately, no good P2P protocol implementation seems to have come out that solves all of the presented issues.

Historically, companies that produced products like Skype or BitTorrent created their own protocols to support them. Those protocols made a lot of assumptions about the environments they'd run on and the needs they'd meet, making them incredibly hard to upgrade or adapt to new environments.

## The solution

So, of course the answer to all of these problems, is a shiny new protocol that solves all of these problems once and for all! Well... not exactly.

</div>

There has to be a better way.
If the main issue is interoperability, what if we could create a better way to integrate all current solutions and open a platform that facilitates innovation? A way that would enable new future solutions to be integrated seamlessly into the networking stack.

Enter libp2p.
