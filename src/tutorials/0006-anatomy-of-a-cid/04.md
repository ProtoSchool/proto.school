Now that we've added a multicodec in IPLD format, our Version 1 CID contains the following fields:

`<ipld-format><multihash-algorithm><multihash-length><multihash-hash>`

But, if you remember from the previous lessons, Version 0 CIDs only contain the `<multihash-*>` parts, so how can we distinguish between different versions of CIDs? You guessed it, more prefixes!

So now our CID looks like this:

`<cid-version><ipld-format><multihash>`

The `<cid-version>` represents the version of the CID (0 or 1).

In the next lesson we'll learn about the final prefix added to the `CIDv1` specification.
