    title: "One hash, multiple CID versions"

You can paste any IPFS CID into the handy [CID Inspector](http://cid.ipfs.io/) to visualize all of its prefixes and what they represent.

In this final lesson we will take a look at some results from this tool using both CIDv0 and CIDv1 formats.

## Example 1: CIDv1

[`bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi`](https://cid.ipfs.io/#bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi)

This first example is a version 1 CID.

Looking at the results from the CID Inspector tool we can see several parts that the tool was able to parse for us:

- `Human Readable CID`: breaks down each part of the CID to be easily readable by us humans
- `Multibase`: `code` is the identifier of the base, in this case `b` for `base32`.
- `Multicodec`: `code` is the identifier of the codec, in this case `0x70` for `dag-pb`, an IPLD format
- `Multihash`: breakdown of the multihash into the hashing algorithm used (`18` is the code for `sha2-256`) and the length of the hash in bits (`256`)

From the "Human Readable CID" breakdown, we can see that the original hash of the content, before the appropriate CIDv1 prefixes are added, is `c3c4733ec8affd06cf9e9ff50ffc6bcd2ec85a6170004bb709669c31de94391a`.

## Example 2: CIDv0

[`QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnR`](https://cid.ipfs.io/#QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnR)

![Results from the CID Inspector tool for the first example](tutorial-assets/T0006L06-example-2.jpg)

This Version 0 CID shows some different results: both the `multibase` and the `multicodec` are listed as "implicit".
Since Version 0 CIDs did not have those prefixes, they are always assumed to be `base58btc` and `dag-pb` respectively.

You may have noticed that the `Base32 CIDV1` part in the end is `bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi`, which is the same CID from the first example!

Notice also how the end of the "Human Readable CID" (the portion after the prefixes) is exactly the same in this CIDv0 example as it was in the CIDv1 example: `c3c4733ec8affd06cf9e9ff50ffc6bcd2ec85a6170004bb709669c31de94391a`.

Why? These two CIDs point to the same content. Basically, it's the same hash (`c3c4733ec8affd06cf9e9ff50ffc6bcd2ec85a6170004bb709669c31de94391a`) represented in the two different versions of the CID spec.

You can convert any `CIDv0` to `CIDv1`, because the implicit prefixes from `v0` become explicit in `v1`.
However, because `CIDv1` supports multiple codecs and multiple bases and `CIDv0` does not, not all `CIDv1` can be converted to `CIDv0`. In fact, only `CIDv1` that have the following properties can be converted to `CIDv0`:

- `multibase = base58btc`
- `multicodec = dag-pb`
- `multihash-algorithm = sha2-256`
- `multihash-length = 256`

To test this theory, you can check out our beloved `Aardvark` page here, hosted on the IPFS network: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Aardvark.html

- Open the link in your browser and copy the CID from the middle of the URL (`QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco`)
- In a new browser window, paste it into the [CID Inspector tool](https://cid.ipfs.io) and find the equivalent CIDv1 value displayed at the bottom of the screen
- Back in your aardvark tab, replace the `v0` CID with the converted `v1` CID in the original URL and refresh the page

You should see the same article on our aardvark.
