As we've discussed, the decentralized web depends on linked data structures. Let's explore
what those look like.

## Merkle trees
A merkle tree, or simple "hash tree," is a tree data structure in which every node is hashed.

```
               +--------+
               |        |
     +---------+  root  +---------+
     |         |        |         |
     |         +----+---+         |
     |              |             |
+----v-----+  +-----v----+  +-----v----+
|          |  |          |  |          |
|  node A  |  |  node B  |  |  node C  |
|          |  |          |  |          |
+----------+  +-----+----+  +-----+----+
                    |             |
              +-----v----+  +-----v----+
              |          |  |          |
              |  node D  |  |  node E  +-------+
              |          |  |          |       |
              +----------+  +-----+----+       |
                                  |            |
                            +-----v----+  +----v-----+
                            |          |  |          |
                            |  node F  |  |  node G  |
                            |          |  |          |
                            +----------+  +----------+
```

In a merkle tree, nodes point to other nodes by content address (hash). Remember,
when we run data through a cryptographic hash, we get back a "hash" or "content address"
that we can think of as a link, so a merkle tree is a collection of linked nodes.

As previously discussed, all content addresses are unique. In the graph above, `node E` contains a reference to the hash for `node F` and `node G`.
This means that the content address (hash) of `node E` is unique to a node containing those addresses.

Getting lost? Let's imagine this as a set of file folders. If we run folder E through our hashing algorithm
while it contains subfolders F and G, the content-derived hash we get back is unique to its current content.
If we remove folder G, it's like Grace removing that whisker from her kitten photo. The folder formerly known as E doesn't
have the same contents anymore, so it gets a new hash.

As the tree above is built, the final content address (hash) of the root node is unique to a
tree that contains every node all the way down this tree. If the data in any node were
to change even by a single byte, the hash of the changed node would change, as would the hashes
of all of its parent nodes.

In case you haven't noticed, this means that as a programmer you'll always need to build
these data structures backwards, from the leaf nodes on up to the root node.

## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)

DAG is an acronym for "Directed Acyclic Graph." It's a fancy way of describing a
specific kind of merkle tree (hash tree) where different branches in the tree can point at other branches
in the tree in a single forward direction, as illustrated by the image above.
