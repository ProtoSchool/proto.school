When we exchange data with peers on the decentralized web, we depend on **content addressing** (as opposed to the **location addressing** of the centralized web) to securely locate and identify data. If you haven't yet done so, please check out our [Decentralized Data Structures](https://proto.school/#/data-structures/) tutorial to learn about the basics of important decentralized web concepts like content addressing, cryptographic hashing, content identifiers (CIDs), and sharing with peers. In this tutorial we'll dig deeper into how CIDs are constructed in IPFS.

A content identifier, or **CID**, is a hash used to address data stored on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io). It doesn't indicate where the content is stored, but it forms a kind of address based on the content itself. CIDs are short, regardless of the size of their underlying content.

For example, if we stored a Wikipedia page on aardvarks on the IPFS network, its CID would look like this:  [`QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco`](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Aardvark.html)

To generate this hash, we use a **cryptographic algorithm** that maps input of arbitrary size (data or a file) to output of a fixed size (a cryptographic hash, also known as fingerprint).

The **cryptographic algorithm** used must generate hashes that have the following characteristics:

- **Deterministic**: The same input should always produce the same hash.
- **Uncorrelated**: A small change in the input should generate a completely different hash.
- **One-way**: It should be infeasible to reconstruct the data from the hash.
- **Unique**: Only one file can produce one specific hash.

Note that if we change a single word in our documentation on aardvarks, our cryptographic algorithm will generate a completely different hash for the article. When we fetch data using a content address, we're guaranteed to see the intended version of that data. This is quite different from location addressing on the centralized web, where the content at a given address (URL) can change over time.

Cryptographic hashing is not unique to IPFS, and there are many hashing algorithms out there like `sha1`, `sha2-256`, `sha3-256`, `sha3-512` and `shake-256`. IPFS uses **`sha2-256`** by default.
