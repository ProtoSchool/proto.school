So now our CID in binary, looks like this:

`<cid-version><multicodec><multihash>`

But binary CIDs are not very human friendly, so just like we saw in the beginning of this tutorial, we can represent these binary CIDs in a string form (binary data represented as text). Example:

`bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi`

But how we do know which base encoding was the string form of the hash converted with?

In `CIDv0` hashes are **always** encoded with `base58btc`. _Always_. This means that we can safely interpret `CIDv0` hashes assuming they are using `base58btc`. But, for performance reasons, we may want to support multiple base encodings. For that, you guessed it, we can add another prefix!

## [Multibase](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase)

![Multibase Prefix](tutorial-assets/T0006L05-multibase-prefix.jpg)

A detail about this prefix, is that it is **only used in the string form of the CID**.

So let's see two examples of CIDs in the string form:

![String form examples](tutorial-assets/T0006L05-string-form.jpg)

The first one is a `CIDv0` because it starts with `Qm...`. All Hashes that start with `Qm` can safely be interpreted as `base58btc` as a CID of version 0.

The second one starts with `bafy...` and the first character `b` is the base encoding prefix indentifier because, usually, most implementations of IPFS by default encode the CIDs using `base32`, which its identifier character is `b`. For the complete list of identifiers of `multibase` see [this table](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase/blob/master/multibase.csv).
