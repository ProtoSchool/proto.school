By using a cryptographic algorithm to generate the hash, we guarantee that we can identify a file with a single hash.

From time to time, a hashing algorithm is broken (stops being compliant with the previously stated rules). This already happened with `sha1`.
Furthermore, with time, other algorithms might not be powerful enough for content addressing in IPFS. For this reason, and also to be able to support multiple cryptographic algorithms, **we need to be able to know which algorithm was used to generate the hash** of specific content.

So how can we do this?
To support multiple hashing algorithms, we use **Multihash**.

## Multihash format

A [**multihash**](https://multiformats.io/multihash/) is basically a self-describing hash. This means that a multihash contains metadata that describes what cryptographic algorithm generated the hash and its' length.
By using multihash, IPFS is future-proof because it **supports multiple hashing algorithms** and therefore is not reliant on the claims of a specific hashing algorithm.

Multihashes follow the `TLV` pattern (`type-length-value`). Essentially, the "original hash" is prefixed with a `type` and the `length` of the hash.

 - `type`: identifier of the **cryptographic algorithm** used to generate the hash (e.g. the identifier of `sha2-256` would be `18` - `0x12` in hexadecimal. see the [multicodec table](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv) for all the identifiers)
 - `length`: the actual **length** of the hash (using `sha2-256` it would be `256`)
 - `value`: the actual **hash value**

To be able to have a compact string form representation of a CID (instead of plain binary), IPFS uses `base58btc` encoding to get the following:

`QmY7Yh4UquoXHLPFo2XbhXkhBvFoPwmQUSa92pxnxjQuPU`

So with this full specification, the first version of CIDs was born! This first version is called version zero: `CIDv0`.
The initial `Qm...` characters are easily spotted on version zero (`CIDv0`) CIDs.

Although, with time, doubts about whether this format would be enough started to come up:

 - How do we know the encoding of the data?
 - How do we know the encoding of the string representation of the hash - will we always be using `base58btc`?

Because of these questions, an evolution to the initial version of a CID was necessary.
In the next lessons we will explore what was added to the CID specification that made into the new CID version: `CIDv1`.
