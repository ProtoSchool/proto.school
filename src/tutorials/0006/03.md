So `CIDv0` supports multiple hashing functions. This means that we can successfully generate a hash for specific content using different hashing algorithms and later on be able to identify content using this hash.

But, when we're trying to read the data itself, how do we know the encoding of the data?
It could be encoded with CBOR, Protobuf, plain JSON, etc.

To solve this issue, we can introduce another prefix that uniquely identifies the encoding used.

## Multicodec prefix

So we add another prefix that indicates which encoding was used on the data.

In this example we see how data encoded with the codec `dag-pb` would be represented in our CID.
`dag-pb` is an [IPLD](https://ipld.io/) codec and many more exist. For the complete list of codecs identifiers, please the [complete table](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv)).
