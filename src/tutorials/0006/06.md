You can use the tool [`cid.ipfs.io`](http://cid.ipfs.io/) to inspect all the parts of a CID.
In this final lesson we will take a look at some results of CIDs from the CID Inspector tool.

## Example 1: CIDv1

[`bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi`](https://cid.ipfs.io/#bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi)

This first example is a version 1 CID.

Looking at the results from the CID Inspector tool we can see several parts that the tool was able to parse for us:

- `Human Readable CID`: breaks down each part of the CID to be easily readable by us humans
- `Multibase`: `code` is the identifier of the base. `b` is the id for `base32`.
- `Multicodec`: again, `code` is the identifier of the codec. `0x70` is the id for `dag-pb`.
- `Multihash`: breakdown of the multihash, `18` is the id for the `sha2-256` hashing algorithm, and `bits=256` is the length of the hash

From the "Human Readable CID" breakdown, we can see that the original hash of the content is `c3c4733ec8affd06cf9e9ff50ffc6bcd2ec85a6170004bb709669c31de94391a`.

## Example 2: CIDv0

[`QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnR`](https://cid.ipfs.io/#QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnR)

Now this version zero CID shows some different results: both the `multibase` and the `multicodec` are "implicit".
The reason for this, as we've explain in the previous lessons, is that version zero CIDs did not have those prefixes, so, they are assumed to be `base58btc` and `dag-pb` respectively, meaning "implicit".

If you're paying attention, you probably noticed that the `Base32 CIDV1` part in the end is `bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi`, which is the same CID from the first example!

Effectively, notice how the end of the "Human Readable CID" is exactly the same as the previous example 1: `c3c4733ec8affd06cf9e9ff50ffc6bcd2ec85a6170004bb709669c31de94391a`.

So it seems that these two CIDs point to the same content. Basically, it's the same hash (`c3c4733ec8affd06cf9e9ff50ffc6bcd2ec85a6170004bb709669c31de94391a`) but represented in the two different versions of the CID spec.

This means you can convert any `CIDv0` to `CIDv1`, because the implicit prefixes from `v0` become explicit in `v1`.
But because `CIDv1` supports multiple codecs and multiple bases and `CIDv0` does not, not all `CIDv1` can be converted to `CIDv0`. In fact, only `CIDv1` that have `multibase=base58btc` and `multicodec=dag-pb` can be converted to `CIDv0`.

To test this theory, you can check our beloved `Aardvark`'s page here: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Aardvark.html

- Copy the CID from the url (`QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco`)
- Convert it in the [CID Inspector tool](https://cid.ipfs.io)
- Replace the `v0` CID with the converted `v1` CID in the original URL

You should see the same page of our `Aardvark`.
