So now our CID contains the following fields:

`<multicodec><multihash>`

But, if you remember from the previous lessons, version zero CIDs only contain the `<multihash>` part, so how can we distinguish between different versions of CIDs? You guessed it, more prefixes!

![Version Prefix](tutorial-assets/T0006L04-version-prefix.jpg)

So now our CID looks like the following:

`<cid-version><multicodec><multihash>`

Where `<cid-version>` represents the version of the CID. In the future, it will increment to 2, 3, 4, etc.

In the next lesson we will learn about the final prefix added to the `CIDv1` specification.
