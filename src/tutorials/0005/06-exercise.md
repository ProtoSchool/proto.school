Use `ls` to list the contents of the root directory you created in the previous exercise.

**Hint:** The CID of the root directory ( `""` ) has been stored for you in the `rootCID` variable in the starter code below. You could have jotted this value down after the last exercise, but here we're looking through the array returned by the `add` method to find the element with the empty string as its `path` (the root directory) and saving its `hash` value, or CID.
