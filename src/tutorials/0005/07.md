So far, we've only been using `CID` as the IPFS path when we want to access a file. However, now that we've learned we can wrap a number of files into a new directory, we have a new way to address a file.

If you remember from our lesson on the [wrapWithDirectory option](https://proto.school/#/file-api/05), we can add several files into a directory and, when doing so, we need to provide a name to each one of the files we add. As a result, the `add` method call returns us an array which contains the hash (`CID`) for each of the files and directories created.

Imagine we called the `add` method like this, in order to add 3 files wrapped by a root directory:

```javascript
await ipfs.add([
    {
        path: 'kitty-pic-list.txt',
        content: catPic1
    },
    {
        path: 'cat-drinking-milk.jpg',
        content: catPic2
    },
    {
        path: 'cat-on-a-table.jpg',
        content: catPic3
    }
], { wrapWithDirectory: true })
```

Which returned this result:

```javascript
[
  {
    "path": "kitty-pic-list.txt",
    "hash": "Qmey7KyqDwo8BfAoVsyLbybQ8LTN3RGbvvY1zV5PeumTLV",
    "size": 19021
  },
  {
    "path": "cat-drinking-milk.jpg",
    "hash": "QmexwNKUeJPmmNR7n4wSzQXrVuyeuQcQikHCHg5xM3mtRq",
    "size": 912035
  },
  {
    "path": "cat-on-a-table.jpg",
    "hash": "QmdC72bumNq5iFrtvTCpm2fvoTsfLzw9rkSU737A8YYyVq",
    "size": 250038
  },
  {
    "path": "",
    "hash": "QmP1j6shbCikCSfnQR7MzJrYdgM6ALpXJAUvkGJFrrwNew",
    "size": 1181341
  }
]
```

And now we want to read the contents of the `kitty-pic-list.txt` file. We can achieve this in two ways:

* As we've done it before, and use the file hash (`CID`) as the IPFS path:
  
```javascript
await ipfs.cat("Qmey7KyqDwo8BfAoVsyLbybQ8LTN3RGbvvY1zV5PeumTLV")
```

* Making use of the root directory hash (`CID`) and the file path:

```javascript
await ipfs.cat("QmP1j6shbCikCSfnQR7MzJrYdgM6ALpXJAUvkGJFrrwNew/kitty-pic-list.txt")
```
