When adding one or multiple files to the IPFS node, you usually get back one `CID` per file, which you can use to access their contents.

If the files are uploaded into a directory, though, IPFS will generate more than one `CID`. You will receive a path for each file you add, as well as a `CID` for the directory itself. We do this by using a special option when calling the `add` function:

```javascript
await ipfs.add(file, { wrapWithDirectory: true })
```

Organizing files into a directory in this way will enable us to do interesting things with the `ls` and `get` methods, which we will talk about in the next two lessons.

The `add` function has many other features, too, which you can check out in the [`add` section](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#add) of the IPFS File API documentation.

## The file argument

To wrap a file with a directory, the `add` function requires a little more help. We need to provide a path with the name we want for each file so we can later access it by using the directory's `CID` and the file name.

In order to send the path information as well as the file contents, we replace the `file` argument in the `add` function call with an object like:

```javascript
{
    path: 'file.txt',
    content: file
}
```

If we want to add multiple files at once — into a single or multiple directories — we just need to pass an array of objects like the one shown above to the `add` method.

For example, imagine we have 3 cat pictures we want to add to a directory on our IPFS node. We would do it like so:

```javascript
await ipfs.add([
    {
        path: 'kitty1.jpg',
        content: catPic1
    },
    {
        path: 'cat-drinking-milk.jpg',
        content: catPic2
    },
    {
        path: 'cat-on-a-table.jpg',
        content: catPic3
    }
], { wrapWithDirectory: true })
```

The `add` method will return information about all the files you added, as well as details about any directory it had to create in order to correctly add the files in the correct paths.

For example, if we added the three pictures in the code example above, the `add` method would return us an array of four elements, one for each picture and another for the directory created.
