## IPFS: The InterPlanetary File System

[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) networking protocol used to share data on the distributed web. You can think of it as a file system with some unique characteristics that make it ideal for safe, decentralized sharing.

If you haven't yet done so, we encourage you to check out our [Decentralized Data Structures](https://proto.school/#/data-structures/) tutorial, to learn all about the decentralized web and how it compares to the one you're accustomed to. There you'll learn all about content addressing, cryptographic hashing, Content Identifiers (CIDs), and sharing with peers, all of which you'll need to understand to make the most of this tutorial.

## The File API vs the DAG API

You can store multiple types of data with IPFS. If you've gone through our Decentralized Data Structures tutorial — or even [Blogging on the Decentralized Web](https://proto.school/#/blog) — you already know you can store primitives, objects and arrays in the network.

Storing these types of data is an interesting, but limited, use case. What if you want to share a picture of a kitten? How would you upload it to the network and provide a way for your friends to see it? What about a larger file, such as a funny video? How should the file be placed in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) — in a single block or split into chunks?

You can think of the File API as an abstraction layer above the DAG API. The File API prepares files to be placed in the network, and ensures that IPFS knows how to access them. The details of what this API actually does will be covered later in this tutorial.

## The Regular File API vs the MFS File API

If you've read our [Mutable File System tutorial](https://proto.school/#/mutable-file-system), you may be thinking, "I've already learned how to use files on IPFS. How will this be any different?"

The Mutable File System (MFS) provides a File API designed to replicate familiar file-system operations such as `mkdir`, `ls`, `cp`, and others. However, the way that content is addressed in IPFS makes it an immutable file system. The address to a file or directory depends on its contents, so any change to a file will result in an entirely new address. The MFS File API works on a familiar looking file system with regular paths — like `/some/stuff` — in the local IPFS node, which hides the complexity of immutable content addressing.

Although MFS is very useful, the abstraction it provides hides some of the inner workings of IPFS. The Regular File API we will discuss here is instead a "bare bones" approach to managing files in IPFS. It trades the powerful abstractions of MFS for a scheme which helps you understand what is actually happening in the file system.
