Now that we've wrapped some files in a directory in our IPFS node, let's learn how we can check its contents. If you use the command line frequently, you're familiar with the `ls` command. IPFS offers a similar `ls` function to list the contents of a directory, which can be called like so:

```javascript
await ipfs.ls(ipfsPath)
```

The `ipfsPath` argument can take many formats, the simplest of which is a CID. (Remember, that's the same string value we saw returned to us as `hash` when we used the `add` command.) For example:

```javascript
await ifps.ls("Qmeybqr2GaiUyGSRWX3dhS2Qz6VTVBXzBiYiFcKpYFJ7tH")
```

You can explore other `ipfsPath` formatting options in the [`ls` documentation for the Regular Files API](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#ls).

The `ls` method in the Regular Files API returns an array of objects, one for each file or directory found, structured like so:

```javascript
{
  "hash": string,
  "path": string,
  "name": string,
  "depth": number,
  "size": number,
  "type": string // can be "file" or "dir"
}
```

Note that there's a different `ls` method in the MFS API (called as `ipfs.files.ls()` rather than `ipfs.ls`) with slightly different properties, which you can learn more about in our MFS tutorial.
