Now that we've uploaded some files into a directory in our IPFS node, let's learn how we can check the contents of a directory. If you use the terminal frequently, you're familiar with the `ls` command. Well, the Files API provides you with an `ls` function to achieve the same purpose.

Calling `ls` looks like this:

```javascript
await ifps.ls( ipfsPath )
```

Where path can take multiple formats, the simplest being a pure `CID`. More information on the formats of the ipfs path can be found in the [`ls` section](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#ls)  of the Files API.

In case the IPFS path we use is a `CID`, the code to `ls` a directory should look a bit like this:

```javascript
await ifps.ls( "Qmeybqr2GaiUyGSRWX3dhS2Qz6VTVBXzBiYiFcKpYFJ7tH" )
```
