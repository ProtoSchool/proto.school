Sometimes we want to know more information about an IPFS path, besides its content in case it's a file.

For this purpose, we have the `get` method, which we can use like this:

```javascript
await ipfs.get(ipfsPath)
```

The result from calling this method is an array of objects with the following structure:

```javascript
{
    hash: string,
    name: string,
    path: string,
    depth: number,
    size: number,
    type: string, //can be "file" or "dir"
    content: Buffer, // only exists if the type === "file"
}
```

Why is the returned value an array? This is one of the advantages the `get` method has over `cat`. Now that we know how we can put files into diferent directories in our IPFS node, it would be interesting to have a way to recursively get the contents of a directory. If we provide an IPFS path of a directory to the `get` method, the returned array will contain every subdirectory and every file present inside the specified directory.

## When should I use `get` and when should I use `cat`

The use case for `cat` is simply to get the contents of a file for which we have an IPFS path.

On the other hand, the `get` method provides us with more information than the contents of a file. It is able to recursively retrieve every file and subdirectory in a directory, tell us which entries are directories and which are files, inform us of the size of a file, the depth of a file in the directory structure, among many other details.
