In this exercise, we will try to read the contents of a file we have already uploaded for you. In order to read its contents, you'll need the path to the file on IPFS, which corresponds to the following `CID`:

```
QmWCscor6qWPdx53zEQmZvQvuWQYxx1ARRCXwYVE4s9wzJ
```

Use the `cat` function to read the contents of the file to a variable.

**Hint:** Don't forget to convert it to a string using `.toString('utf8')` before returning the result.
