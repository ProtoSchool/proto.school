For this last challenge, we've created the following file structure in the root directory of your IPFS node:

```
/
/shrug.txt
/smile.txt
/fun/
/fun/success.txt
```

The CID of the root directory is: `"QmcmnUvVV31txDfAddgAaNcNKbrtC2rC9FvkJphNWyM7gy"`

Use the `get` method to return data on all of the files and subdirectories contained in the root directory.

**Hint:** Be sure to return the array created by the `get` method.
