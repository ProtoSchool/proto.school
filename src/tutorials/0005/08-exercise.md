In this last lesson of this tutorial, we will use the `get` method we learned about to get all the files and directories from a directory structure.

The file structure has been created for us, and it looks like this: 

```
/
/file1.txt
/file2.txt
/dir/
/dir/success.txt
```

In order to use the `get` function to obtain all the files and directories, we will need an IPFS path for the root directory. The IPFS path is this `CID`:

`"QmX1rvLYrhqfnnjvrFqudYZgQyomZxS9U9p5e8Dn3ot4Jk"`

**Hint:**
* Don't forget to return the result of the `get` function.
