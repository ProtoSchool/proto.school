For this exercise, we've added a plain text file to your IPFS node for you, and its CID is:

```
'QmWCscor6qWPdx53zEQmZvQvuWQYxx1ARRCXwYVE4s9wzJ'
```

Using the `cat` function, retrieve the file's contents and return them as a string.

**Hint:** Don't forget to convert the buffered contents of the text file to a string using `.toString('utf8')` before returning your result.
