When adding one or multiple files to the IPFS node, you usually get back a simple `CID` so you know how to access those files.

There is a possibility, however, to place the files you are uploading into a directory. By doing this, you also get back a path for each file you add, as well as a `CID` for the directory itself. We do this by using a special option when calling the `add` function, like this:

```javascript
await ipfs.add(file, { wrapWithDirectory: true })
```

Having a directory with the files you have will allow us to do interesting things with the `ls` and `get` command, which we will talk about in the next two lessons.

The `add` function has plenty of other options, which you can check out at the [add section of the IPFS File API documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#add).

## The file argument

When we want to add a file wrapped within a directory, we can no longer simply call the `add` function with the file itself. We need provide a path so that the ipfs node knows which directories to create.

In these cases, we replace the `file` argument in the `add` function call with an object like:

```javascript
{
    path: '/some/file.txt',
    content: file
}
```

If we want to add multiple files at once, into a single or multiple directories, we just need to pass to `add` an array of objects like the one shown above.
