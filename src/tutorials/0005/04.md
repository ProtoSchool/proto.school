When adding one or multiple files to the IPFS node, you usually get back one `CID` per file, which you can use to access their contents.

If the files are uploaded into a directory, though, IPFS will generate more than one `CID`. You will receive a path for each file you add, as well as a `CID` for the directory itself. We do this by using a special option when calling the `add` function:

```javascript
await ipfs.add(file, { wrapWithDirectory: true })
```

Organizing files into a directory in this way will enable us to do interesting things with the `ls` and `get` methods, which we will talk about in the next two lessons.

The `add` function has many other features, too, which you can check out in the [`add` section](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#add) of the IPFS File API documentation.

## The file argument

To upload multiple nested directories, the `add` function requires a little more help. We need to provide a path in order for the ipfs node to properly replicate the directory structure.

In these cases, we replace the `file` argument in the `add` function call with an object like:

```javascript
{
    path: '/some/file.txt',
    content: file
}
```

If we want to add multiple files at once — into a single or multiple directories — we just need to pass an array of objects like the one shown above to the `add` method.
