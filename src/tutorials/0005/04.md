Now that we've learned how to put some files onto your IPFS node, we can use their addresses ([CID's](https://proto.school/#/data-structures/04)) to get their content. If you're familiar with UNIX style commands, you probably know `cat`. The IPFS File API also provides a `cat` function for the same purpose: to get the contents of a file.


## How to find a file in an IPFS node

As we saw in the previous lesson, the `add` method returned an object -- or an array of objects -- with the following structure:

```javascript
{
    path: string,
    hash: string,
    size: number
}
```

The `hash` property in this object is a `CID` pointing to the file, which means we can use it to find the file in the IPFS node when we want to read its contents.

## Using `cat`

To get the contents of a file in IPFS, we call the `cat` function:

```javascript
await ipfs.cat(ipfsPath, [options], [callback])
```

If we knew the path to a file in IPFS we wanted to read, we could call the `cat` method like this:

```javascript
await ipfs.cat('QmWCscor6qWPdx53zEQmZvQvuWQYxx1ARRCXwYVE4s9wzJ')
```


The IPFS path can take several formats (you can read about them in the [File API](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#cat) documentation). In this lesson, we will use the simplest one: the `hash` string present in the objects we receive when the `ipfs.add` function is called.

The returned data comes in the form of an `Buffer`. If you uploaded a plain text file (such as a `.txt`), you can read the contents of the file by calling `result.toString('utf8')`.

So if you have the `CID` to a text file whose contents you want to read, you can do this:

```javascript
let bufferedContents = await ipfs.cat(cid) // returns a buffer
let contents = bufferedContents.toString('utf8') // a string
```

When you're ready to try this in the real world, you should note that the `cat` method can result in heavy memory usage, depending on the contents of the file being read. If you find this to be the case, you might want to explore the [catReadableStream](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#catreadablestream) or [catPullStream](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#catpullstream) methods instead.
