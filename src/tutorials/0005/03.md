## Working with files in ProtoSchool
Here in our ProtoSchool tutorials, we create a new IPFS node for you in the browser each time you hit the "Submit" button in a lesson. Whenever you see `ipfs.someMethod()` in our lessons, `ipfs` is a variable that refers to your IPFS instance, also known as a node. The actions that you take only affect your own IPFS node, not nodes belonging to your peers.

We create this special IPFS node behind the scenes so that you can focus on the content of our lessons.  Outside of ProtoSchool, though, you'd need to host your own node locally by installing IPFS and running a daemon in your terminal. When you're ready to experiment with that, you can visit the IPFS docs site to learn how to [install IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/guides/install/) and [initialize your node](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/usage/#initialize-the-repository).

As mentioned previously, the methods discussed in this tutorial are part of the IPFS [Files API](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md). Check the documentation for more specific details, such as options for each API function.

## Add a file

First let's learn how to add a file to your IPFS node. We'll do this by executing the `add` method:

```javascript
await ipfs.add(data, [options], [callback])
```

So if we had the `File` object for an adorable photo of a kitten in our browser, accessible to us via a variable `catPic`, and we wanted to add it to our IPFS node, we could pass it into the `add` method as `data` like so:

```javascript
await ipfs.add(catPic)
```

Note that the `add` method can accept either a single `File` or an array, just in case you have more than one adorable animal photo to add to the network:

```javascript
await ipfs.add([catPic, dogPic, giraffePic])
```

Because the `add` function returns a `Promise`, you'll need to place an `await` before the function call to block the execution until the return value of the promise is ready to be used.

The result of this `Promise` is an array of objects, one for each file added to IPFS, in the following format:

```javascript
{
    path: string,
    hash: string,
    size: number
}
```

The value of the `hash` is a `CID` (Content Identifier), a unique address generated based on the content of the node. (For a more in-depth look at how `CID`s are generated and why they're important, check out our [Decentralized data structures](https://proto.school/#/data-structures) tutorial.) In a future lesson, we will learn how to use this value to retrieve the contents of a file.

The `add` method accepts other `data` formats besides the `File` object and offers many advanced `options` for setting your chunk size and hashing algorithm, pinning files as they're added, and more. We're highlighting the basics in this tutuorial, but you can check out the [full documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#add) for to learn more.
