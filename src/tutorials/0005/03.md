Now that we've learned how to put some files on your IPFS node, we need to learn how can use their addresses ([CID's](https://proto.school/#/data-structures/04)) to get their content. If your familiar with UNIX style commands, you probably know `cat`. The IPFS File API provides a function with that same name to achieve the same purpose, that is, get the contents of a file.

## Using `cat`

When we want to get the contents of a file in IPFS, we call the `cat` function:

```javascript
await ipfs.cat(ipfsPath, [options], [callback])
```

The IPFS path can take several formats, you can read about them in the [File API documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#cat). In this lesson, we will use the simplest form, which is the `hash` string present in the objects we receive from the calling the `ipfs.add` function.

The returned data comes in the form of an `Buffer`. If the file you uploaded is a plain text file, for example a `.txt`, you can read the contents of the file by calling `result.toString('utf8')`.

For example, if you have the `CID` to a text file whose contents you want to read you can do this:

```javascript
let bufferedContents = await ipfs.cat(cid) // returns a buffer
let contents = bufferedContents.toString('utf8') // a string
```

When you're ready to try this in the real world, you should note that `cat` method can result in heavy memory usage based on the contents of the file being read. You might want to explore the [catReadableStream](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#catreadablestream) or [catPullStream](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#catpullstream) methods instead.
