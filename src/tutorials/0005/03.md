## Working with files in ProtoSchool
Here in our ProtoSchool tutorials, we create a new IPFS node for you in the browser each time you hit the "Submit" button in a lesson. Whenever you see `ipfs.someMethod()` in our lessons, `ipfs` is a variable that refers to your IPFS instance, also known as a node. The actions that you take only affect your own IPFS node, not nodes belonging to your peers.

We create this special IPFS node behind the scenes, so you can focus on the content of our lessons. To host a fully functional IPFS node of your own, though, IPFS must be installed on your machine, and a local daemon running in your terminal. If you haven't already experimented with this, visit our docs to learn how to [install IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/guides/install/) and [initialize your node](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/usage/#initialize-the-repository).

As mentioned previously, the methods discussed in this tutorial are part of the [Files API](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md). Check the documentation for more specific details, such as options for each API function.

## Add a file

First let's learn how to add a file to your IPFS node. We'll do this by executing the following expression:

```javascript
await ipfs.add(data, [options], [callback])
```

So if we had a file object in our browser, accessible via a variable catPic, and we wanted to add it to our IPFS node, we could do it like so:

```javascript
await ipfs.add(catPic)
```

You can find the full documentation for this method [here](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#add).

It's important to note that whether you want to add a `File` or multiple `File`s, you can pass either a `File` or an array of `File`s as an argument to the `add` method.

The `add` function returns a `Promise`, so you can place an `await` before the function call to block the execution until the return value of the promise is ready to be used.

The result of this `Promise` is an array of objects with the following structure:
```javascript
{
    path: string,
    hash: string,
    size: number
}
```

This `hash` is what we call a `CID`, a generated address based on the content of the node. For a more in depth look of how `CID`s are generated and what they are, feel free to take a look at the [Decentralized data structures](https://proto.school/#/data-structures) tutorial.

In a future lesson, we will learn how to use this `hash`, or `CID`, to get the contents of a file.
