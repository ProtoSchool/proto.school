One important feature of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) is the ability to link them together.

The way you express links in the `ipfs` DAG store is with the `CID` of
another node.

For example, if we wanted one node to have a link called "foo" pointed
to another CID instance previously saved as `barCid`, it might look like:

```javascript
{
  foo: barCid
}
```
When we give a field a name and make its value a link to a CID, we call this a named link.
