You can read data from deeply nested objects using path queries.

```javascript
let cid = await ipfs.dag.put({
  my: {
    deep: {
      obj: 'is cool'
    }
  }
})

console.log(await ipfs.dag.get(cid, '/my/deep/obj'))
// prints { value: 'is cool', remainderPath: '' }
```

`ipfs.dag.get` allows queries using IPFS paths.
These queries return an object containing the value of the query and any remaining path that was unresolved.

The cool thing about this API is that it can also traverse through links.

```javascript
let cid = await ipfs.dag.put({ foo: 'bar' })
let cid2 = await ipfs.dag.put({
  my: {
    other: cid
  }
})

console.log(await ipfs.dag.get(cid2, '/my/other/foo'))
// prints { value: 'bar', remainderPath: '' }
```
*Gotcha!* Notice above how this method returns not the value itself, but rather an object that contains a `value` property. You can't access that `value` property until the promise completes, a problem which can be solved in two ways:

```javascript
// Option 1: Wrap your await statement in parentheses to let the promise complete
return (await ipfs.dag.get(cid2, '/my/other/foo')).value

// Option 2: Save the result to a variable and then access its value
let cid3 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid2, '/my/other/foo')
return cid3.value
```
