When we add a file to MFS using `files.write`, there's no value returned
by the method, but we can still check to ensure everything worked as expected.

In the Mutable File System, we can inspect directories using the [`files.ls`](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#filesls)
method. It should feel very familiar if you've ever used the command line to list
the contents of directories on your computer.

The `files.ls` method looks like this:

```js
ipfs.files.ls([path], [options])
```

The method will default to listing the contents of your root directory ( `/` ), or
you can choose to specify a specific `path` (directory) you'd like to inspect,
such as `/catPics`,

`files.ls` produces an array of objects, one for each file or directory
contained in the directory you're inspecting, with the following properties:

- `name`: the file's name
- `type`: the object's type (`0` - file or `1` - directory)
- `size`: the size of the file in bytes
- `cid`: the Content Identifier (CID), that identifies your file in IPFS

If we wanted to view all available details for the contents of a `/catPics`
directory, we could do it like this:

```js
ipfs.files.ls('/catPics')
```

Because the `files.ls` method returns an [`Async Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of), you'll need to call the iterable multiple times until you have all the results.

For this, we can use a `for await...of` loop:

```javascript
const result = []

for await (const resultPart of ipfs.files.ls('/catPics')) {
    result.push(resultPart)
}
```

To make things easier, we can use the `it-all` package that does this automatically:

```javascript
// the all variable is globally available (just like ipfs)

const result = await all(ipfs.files.ls('/catPics'))
```

You can learn more about the available options in the [`files.ls` API documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#filesls).
