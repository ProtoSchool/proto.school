    title: "The current problem with P2P Protocols"
    type: "multiple-choice"
---

IPFS is not the first attempt at creating a P2P protocol. P2P concepts and implementations have been around for decades.
A few examples are: Skype (originally developed as a P2P video call app), Gnutella, KaZaA, eMule, and BitTorrent.

## P2P state of the art

One of the main problems with P2P connections is discoverability: how can two or more peers find each other and share information? These apps all had to solve this and more issues and each of them implemented their own solutions with different ideas and approaches.

In fact, IPFS found inspiration on the current and past state of the art to try and improve its P2P system.
There were a lot scientific papers from the academia world that provided ideas on how to solve some of these issues. Those researches had some preliminary results, so there had to be code implementations that could be used and adapted.
But the truth is that those implementations were really hard to find, or couldn't be found at all. Some of the most common situations would be:

- Lack of good documentation or none at all
- Restrictive licensing or no license to be found
- Very old code with the last update more than a decade ago
- No point of contact (no maintainer available to reach)
- Closed source (or product) or the source doesn't exist anymore
- No specification
- Implementation doesn't expose a friendly API
- Tightly coupled with a specific use


So in the end, every time P2P protocols needed to be used, its challenges needed to be solved again and again because there was no way to re-use those software packages that implemented P2P protocols.

One would think that this was a problem of the past.
The open-source community has evolved over the years and built a robust ecosystem that provides thousands of open-source software packages that include a thorough battery of test suites, good documentation, and friendly APIs.
But unfortunately, no good P2P protocol implementation seems to have come out that solves all of the presented issues.

For the most part, P2P protocol implementations make a lot of assumptions about the environments they run on that compromise the protocol's future, and they also turned out to be incredibly hard to upgrade or adapt to new environments.

## The solution

So, of course the answer to all of these problems, is a shiny new protocol that solves all of these problems once and for all! Well... not exactly.

There has to be a better way.
If the main issue is interoperability, what if we could create a better way to integrate all current solutions and open a platform that facilitates innovation? A way that would enable new future solutions to be integrated seamlessly into the networking stack.

Enter libp2p.
