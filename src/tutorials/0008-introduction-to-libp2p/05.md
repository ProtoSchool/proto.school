`libp2p` has multiple implementations and they all interop with each other.
At the time of writing this, we have 3 implementations: `Javascript`, `Go`, and `Rust`.

## Browser support

<div class="flex justify-center items-start mv4">
    <img src="/tutorial-assets/T0008L05-libp2p-browser.png">

</div>

The javascript implementation works in browsers and mobile browsers too! This is very important because it enables applications to run `libp2p` in the desktop and mobile devices as well.

And you only need to change some lines of code in the `libp2p` bundle to go from the `NodeJs` version to the browser version.

<div class="pa3 bg-near-white i">
<span class="b f5">libp2p bundle: </span> <span> file that creates a configured `libp2p` node ready to be used. It bundles all the required `libp2p` modules, i.e., `libp2p-tcp`, `libp2p-websockets`, etc.</span>

</div>

Let's take a look at how a `NodeJs` libp2p bundle would look like:

<div class="flex justify-center mv4">
    <img src="/tutorial-assets/T0008L05-libp2p-bundle-node.png">
</div>

The first part imports all the necessary `libp2p` modules that make up this network stack.
The second part is the `libp2p` node configuration where we add the different modules for each part of the network. In this configuration we are using `transport`, `streamMuxer`, `connEncryption`, `peerDiscovery` and `dht`.

Now for this code to run in the browser we only need to change the `transport` protocols and the `peerDiscovery` protocols. In `libp2p`, to implement this change you only need to change this `libp2p` bundle file, no other changes in the application are required:


<div class="flex justify-center mv5 flex-wrap">
    <span class="tc b f6 w-50">NodeJs</span>
    <span class="tc b f6 w-50">Browser</span>
    <img class="w-50" src="/tutorial-assets/T0008L05-libp2p-bundle-node-highlight.png">
    <img class="w-50" src="/tutorial-assets/T0008L05-libp2p-bundle-browser-highlight.png">
    <span class="tc f6 ph4 w-50">`TCP` and `WebSockets` in `transport`; `MulticastDNS` in `peerDiscovery`</span>
    <span class="tc f6 ph4 w-50">`WebSockets` and `WebRTC` in `transport`; `WebRTC` derived discovery</span>
</div>

In this example, we only had to change very few lines of code to convert a NodeJs `libp2p` bundle into a browser `libp2p` bundle.
