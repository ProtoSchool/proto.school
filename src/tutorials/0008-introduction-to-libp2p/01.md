**[libp2p](https://libp2p.io) is modular network stack** and it has evolved out of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) to become an independent project.

In order to explain why libp2p is such an important piece of the decentralized web, we need to take a few steps back and understand what problems is libp2p trying to solve and where it comes from.

## Web 2.0

We've grown to love the internet and we use it in our everyday lives.
We use it for looking up definitions and study, connect with friends and family, shopping, manage our finances and much more.
So in reality, we've become dependent on internet, to a point where we really need it to be reliable and safe.

And that's not really the case in this day and age. We've all experienced connectivity issues, and we also feel that our identity and data are not safe across the multiple online services that we use daily.

## Location Addressing vs Content Addressing

A lot of the issues that we face, come from using a [Location Addressing](http://protoschool.localhost/data-structures/02) approach to find the content the user is looking for, and serve it from that address. For example, we expect that our cat's picture is available at https://catsoftheworld.com/goldberg.jpg, but what if the server of this website is down? What if the DNS server is down? What if the picture was converted to a PNG file and so the new location is `goldberg.png`? What if you are in a country that has blocked the `catsoftheworld.com` domain?
All of these issues are common ones and are caused by `Location Addressing`, where we try to find the content we need by it's location.

[IPFS](https://ipfs.io), however, approaches this problem in a different way by using [Content Addressing](https://proto.school/data-structures/03) instead.
Before, we knew the location of our cat Goldberg's picture, but, if instead we know it's [CID](https://proto.school/anatomy-of-a-cid) (Content IDentifier) we can then ask who has the picture with this CID.
The advantages in this approach are very appealing since they solve all the other issues before mentioned, but to get it right there are other problems that need to be tackled first, specifically within networking.


## Networks are complex

If we want to have a web powered by `Content Addressing`, we need to redesign and re-imagine how computer networks work.
Networks are very complex systems that have their own rules and restrictions, and so when designing these systems, we need to take into account a lot of situations and use cases:

- **Firewalls**: You might have a firewall installed in your laptop that blocks or restricts specific connections.
- **NAT**: Your home wifi router with NAT (Network Address Translation) which translates your local IP address of your laptop to a single IP address that networks outside your home can connect to.
- **High latency networks**: these networks have very slow connections and leave users waiting a long time to see their content.
- **Reliability**: there are a lot of networks scattered around the world, and more often than not, a lot of users encounter slow networks that do not have robust systems in place to offer good connectivity to users. Connections drop frequently and users are left with a subpar network system that does not serve the users as it should.
- **Roaming**: Mobile addressing is another situation where we need guarantee that the users' devices remain uniquely discoverable when navigating through different networks across the world. Currently they work in a distributed system that requires a lot of coordination points and connections, but the best solution would be a decentralized one.
- **Censorship**: in the current state of the web, blocking a website in a specific website domain is relatively easy to do if you are a governmental entity. This is useful to block illegal activity, but becomes a problem when, for example, an authoritarian regime wants to remove access to resources from its population.
- **Runtimes with different properties**: there are numerous different types of runtimes around, and let's take IoT (Internet of Things) devices (raspberry pi, arduino, etc) which are gaining a lot of adoption. Because they are built with limited resources, its runtimes are often using different protocols that make a lot of assumptions about their runtime.
- **Innovation is very slow**: Even the most successful companies with a lot of resources can take decades to develop and deploy new protocols.

Ouch, this is a long list!
But these are the issues that IPFS had to solve in order to create successful P2P (Peer-to-Peer) communications.

The truth is, as we will see in the next lesson, IPFS is not the first project to try and solve these issues and create P2P communications.
