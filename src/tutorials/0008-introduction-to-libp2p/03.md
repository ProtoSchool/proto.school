`libp2p` is the networking stack of IPFS, but extracted away from IPFS, becoming a first class project and a dependency of IPFS itself.

</div>

This way, `libp2p` is able to grow further without being attached specifically to `IPFS`, gaining its own ecosystem and community. `IPFS` simply becomes one of the many users of `libp2p`.

This way each project can solely focus on their own objectives:

- `IPFS` is more focused on *__Content Addressing__*, i.e., find, fetch and authenticate any piece of content in the web. 
- `libp2p` is more focused on *__Process Addressing__*, i.e., find, connect and authenticate any process in the network.


Finding, connecting and authenticating any process in the network is a bold claim to make. So how has `libp2p` done it? The answer is **modularity**.

## Modularity

`libp2p` has identified specific pieces that can makeup a network stack:

So a user can choose the specific pieces they need and compose their own bundle, tailored for their use cases.

All of those pieces have very well defined **interfaces** that enable interoperability and easy upgrades that create a future proof networking stack.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="/tutorial-assets/T0008L03-libp2p-interfaces.png">
</div>

All of these interfaces allow the creation of an ecosystem of modules that all follow the same interfaces. For example, let's look at the *Transport* interface.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="/tutorial-assets/T0008L03-libp2p-interface-transport.png">
</div>

We can see seven modules that implement the transport interface.
So if we want to switch the transport protocol from `TCP` to `UDP` we can do that easily by simply switching from `js-libp2p-tcp` to `js-libp2p-udp`.

If we are missing a module that needs to be implemented, we just need to implement the interface and use the test suite provided with the interface to validate its implementation.
In the [implementation](https://libp2p.io/implementations/) page of the libp2p website, we can keep track of the progress of the interfaces implementations for many different modules and parts.
