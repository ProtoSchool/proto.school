`libp2p` is the networking stack of IPFS, but extracted away from IPFS, becoming a first class project and a dependency of IPFS itself.

</div>

This way, `libp2p` is able to grow further without being attached specifically to `IPFS`, gaining its own ecosystem and community. `IPFS` simply becomes one of the many users of `libp2p`.

This way each project can solely focus on their own objectives:

- `IPFS` is more focused on *__Content Addressing__*, i.e., find, fetch and authenticate any piece of content in the web. 
- `libp2p` is more focused on *__Process Addressing__*, i.e., find, connect and authenticate any data transfer processes in the network.


Finding, connecting and authenticating any process in the network is a bold claim to make. So how has `libp2p` done it? The answer is **modularity**.

## Modularity

`libp2p` has identified specific pieces that can makeup a network stack:

For the purpose of this tutorial, you don't need to understand what all of these pieces are, but it's important to understand how many components there are to consider when building a network stack. If you want to learn more about this, you can check `libp2p` documentation's website [Concepts](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/) page.

A user can choose the specific pieces they need and compose their own bundle, tailored for their use cases.
All of those pieces have very well defined **interfaces** that enable interoperability and easy upgrades that create a future proof networking stack.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="/tutorial-assets/T0008L03-libp2p-interfaces.png">
</div>

All of these interfaces allow the creation of an ecosystem of modules that all follow the same interfaces.

We can compare it to buying a couch. Sure, you can buy one after long weeks of searching for the perfect one you like that will fit your living room perfectly, but in the end, it's still not exactly as you wanted it to be.
What if instead, you can go to an online store that allows you to order your own couch setup with exactly the colours you want and the materials you want.
This couch company as acknowledged the basic building blocks that make up a couch (1-seater, 2-seater or 3-seater? with or without chaise lounge? Velvet, fiber or leather?), and it has provided a web service that allows customers to build the couch they want.
This is the modularity that libp2p provides. It has formalized the building blocks into interfaces (Transport, Discovery, etc) so that they can be implemented in different ways (TCP, UDP, etc).


For example, let's look at the *Transport* interface. *Transports* are a collection of foundational protocols that define how data is transferred. Even within this one module, there are many decisions to make, such as how many bytes are sent with each chunk of data, whether they should be verified for integrity individually or all at once, etc.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="/tutorial-assets/T0008L03-libp2p-interface-transport.png">
</div>

We can see seven modules that implement the transport interface.
So if we want to switch the transport protocol from `TCP` to `UDP` we can do that easily by simply switching from `js-libp2p-tcp` to `js-libp2p-udp`.

If we are missing a module that needs to be implemented, we just need to implement the interface and use the test suite provided with the interface to validate its implementation.
In the [implementation](https://libp2p.io/implementations/) page of the libp2p website, we can keep track of the progress of the interfaces implementations for many different modules and parts.
