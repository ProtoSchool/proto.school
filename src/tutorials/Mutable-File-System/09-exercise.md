We've created a text file containing a secret message and stored it on the IPFS network under CID `Qme1zmi8dxBiVM7K9y5J3oPxiWWBgzA7n9M6tkmkz8kSwV`. Copy it from the IPFS network into your `/some/stuff` directory in MFS, giving it the name `success.txt`.

**Hint:** Notice that an IPFS path starts with `/ipfs/` and ends with a CID.
