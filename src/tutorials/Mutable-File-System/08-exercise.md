Your root directory should currently contain one or more files that you uploaded, plus your `/some/stuff` directory. Move the files into the `some/stuff` directory.

**Hint** Be sure to only move files, not directories. Remember that each object in IPFS has a `type` property that you can use to determine whether it's a file or a directory. Files have type `0` and directories have type `1`.
