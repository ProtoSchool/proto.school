Your root directory currently contains one or more loose files that you uploaded, plus your `/some/stuff` directory. Move the loose files into the `some/stuff` directory.

**Hint** When you loop through items in your root directory, remember that each has a `type`. For files, the type is `0` and for directories it's `1`.
