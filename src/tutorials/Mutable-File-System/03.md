When working with your IPFS node, you'll often want to check the status of a file or directory. You can do this with `ipfs.files.stat`, passing in the path you'd like to check on.

For example, to check the status of a directory called `stuff` located within our root directory (`/`), we could call the method like so:

`await ipfs.files.stat('/stuff/')`

This method returns an object with some essential data about our file or directory:

* **hash** (a string with the cryptographic hash)
* **size** (an integer with the file or folder size in Bytes)
* **cumulativeSize** (an integer with the size of the DAGNodes making up the file in Bytes)
* **type** (a string that can be either `directory` or `file`)
* **blocks** (if type is `directory`, this is the number of files in the directory; if type is `file`, it's the number of blocks that make up the file)
* **withLocality** (a boolean to indicate if locality information are present)
* **local** (a boolean to indicate if the queried dag is fully present locally)
* **sizeLocal** (an integer indicating the cumulative size of the data present locally)

It's important to note that you can `stat` your IPFS node even when you don't have anything in it yet. Even empty nodes have CIDs (hashes) that represent their contents.
