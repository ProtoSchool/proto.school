MFS allows you to move files between directories just as you would on your local machine, using the [`files.mv` method.](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#filesmv)

The method looks like this:
```js
ipfs.files.mv(...from, to, [options])
```

`from` is the source path (or paths) of the content you'd like to move. `to` is the destination path.

In order to create parent directories that don't already exist, you'll need to use the `{ parents: true }` option.

You can use `files.mv` to perform a number of different operations:

```js
// move a single file into a directory
ipfs.files.mv('/source-file.txt', '/destination-directory')

// move multiple files into a directory (note the two acceptable formats)
ipfs.files.mv('/source-file-1.txt', '/source-file-2.txt', '/destination-directory')
ipfs.files.mv(['/source-file-1.txt', '/source-file-2.txt'], '/destination-directory')

// move a directory into another directory
ipfs.files.mv('/source-directory', '/destination-directory')

// overwrite the contents of a destination file with the contents of a source file
ipfs.files.mv('/source-file.txt', '/destination-file.txt')
```
Notice that we don't use `await` with `files.mv` because it's not an async function.

**Note:** `files.mv` takes longer when you move larger files. If you've been working with large files for these lessons, please click "Start Over" above the file upload window and select smaller files.
