We hid a secret message for you in that file you copied from IPFS as `success.txt`. Use `files.read` to save the content of the file (as a string) to the `secretMessage` variable we've created for you below.

**Hint:** Remember that you'll need to convert the buffer returned by `files.read` to a string.

**NOTE: Validation isn't yet complete for this lesson. Need to comment out the line with the CP command and upload a `success.txt` file insted because earlier cp lesson doesn't work yet.**
