## Data added to IPFS is stored in a local node

One of the most common questions for those new to IPFS is where content lives when it's added to the network.

As a peer-to-peer data storage system, IPFS allows each user (peer) to host whatever data they'd like locally. Typically you'd install IPFS on your own computer and create a new instance of IPFS (also known as a node) there. That's where your data would live locally, referenced by content addresses (CIDs). Data stored in IPFS can take many forms, but one of the most common use cases is the sharing of tradional files, which we'll learn more about in this tutorial.

You could choose to share your data or files with your peers when you had a network connection, but if you were the only one hosting a particular resource, it would become unavailable to your peers when your machine went offline. Having multiple peers hosting the same files is what makes them more readily available, and using CIDs is what makes this system secure. We'll talk more about sharing in future tutorials, but for now we'll focus on how to work with files within your own IPFS instance.

## Working with your IPFS node in ProtoSchool

Here in our ProtoSchool tutorials, rather than using your machine itself, we're creating a new IPFS node for you in the browser each time you hit the "Submit" button in a lesson.

Whenever you see `ipfs.someMethod()` in our lessons, `ipfs` is a variable that refers to your IPFS instance. When you replicate this process on your own machine, you can choose to call your node `ipfs` or `node` or `myNode` or `zebra`... the choice is yours! What's important to know is that the methods we're showing you will only affect your own instance of IPFS.

We're creating your IPFS node behind the scenes so you can focus on the content of our lessons, but eventually you'll need to learn to host your own node locally. When you're ready to experiment, you can find instructions for [installing IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/install/) and [initializing your node](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/usage/) in our docs.

Let's start exploring how we can work with files in IPFS!
