In our Decentralized Data Structures tutorial, we discussed the
concept of a content identifier, or CID (if you haven’t reviewed
that lesson yet, we’d highly recommend you do so, as this
tutorial builds on the concepts it introduces!) To quickly recap
that material, a CID functions like a fingerprint for a blob of
data, and consists primarily of a cryptographic hash of the data
itself. We can use this identifier as a unique and succinct name
to point to that data. Because the name is unique, we can use it
as a link, replacing location-based identifiers, like URLs, with
ones based on the content of the data itself.

However, links aren’t just used for identifying specific content;
they’re fundamental for representing, organizing, and traversing
structured information. In all kinds of objects and systems in
our daily lives -- telephone directories, bibliographies, mind
maps, taxonomies, and more-- linked data has *structure*, and that
structure connotes relationships in the data itself. In this
tutorial, we will explore that notion, learning how we can
structure linked data to create a rich semantic foundation for
the distributed web.
