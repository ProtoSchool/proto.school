In a Proof of Replication, a storage miner proves that they are storing a _physically_ unique copy, or _replica_, of the data in a sector, the fundamental storage unit used by Filecoin.

## The pre-commit phase: Replication & CommD

In the _pre-commit_ phase, the storage miner places the piece data received into a sector. Once a sector is full, a CommD (Commitment of Data, aka UnsealedSectorCID) is produced, representing the root node of all the piece CIDs contained in the sector. Most often, this will be an aggregate of pieces from a number of different clients.

## The commit phase: Sealing & CommR

In the _commit_ phase, a process called _sealing_ takes place. Sealing is a sequential operation which gradually generates an encoding of the data for each miner, also known as a unique replica. (Note that encoding is not the same as encryption. If you want to store private data, you must encrypt it before adding it to the Filecoin network.)

The sealing process produces a CommR (Commitment of Replication, aka SealedSectorCID), which is the root hash of the replica created by encoding ("sealing") the file identified by the CommD. This CommR offers the proof we need that the miner is storing a physically unique copy of the client's data. If you store the same data with multiple storage miners, they will each create a different CommR.

This Proof of Replication happens just once, at the time the data is first stored by the miner and sealed into a sector.

The sealing process also compresses the Proof of Replication using zk-SNARKs to keep the chain smaller so that it can be stored by all members of the Filecoin network for verification purposes. We'll learn more about zk-SNARKs in a future lesson.
