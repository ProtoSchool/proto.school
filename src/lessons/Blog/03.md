We want to be able to group blog posts by tag. In order to do that, we create a node for each tag with links to the blog post.

### Task

Add a node for each of the tags: outdoor, hobby and link all corresponding blog posts. The structure of the node is like this:

```
{
  tag: "name-of-the-tag",
  posts: [
    // links to the CIDs
  ]
}
```

Return the CIDs of the newly created tag nodes as an array.
