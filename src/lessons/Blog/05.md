Let’s say your overview page is listing your blog posts strictly chronological. You could do it the same way as with the tags. You would need to update that page (create a new node), every time you add a new blog post. That sounds like a lot of waste, creating new nodes with only a small thing changed. There’s a better way. Whenever you create a new blog post, you can link to the previous one directly.

You can use those links to create the overview page dynamically.

### Task

 - Add a field named `prev` which links to the previous blog post. The chronological order is (starting with the oldest): “trees”, “computers”, “dogs”
 - Return the CID of the newest blog post “dogs”
