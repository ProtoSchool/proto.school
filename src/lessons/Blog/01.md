This exercise has some prepared code to get started faster. It resembles a blog. There are authors (Nat and Sam) and some blog posts about trees and computers. At the moment there’s no relation between them. Let’s update the blog posts so that they link to the author.

In the [basic lessons](#/Basics/02) we learned that a link in IPLD is represented as an object with a slash as its only field:

```javascript
const link = {'/': 'a-base-encoded-cid'}
```

Modify the two existing blog posts and add a new field `author` that links to the author of the blog post. The post about trees was authored by Sam and Nat wrote the post about computers. Remember to use `toBaseEncodedString()` to make the CID links.
