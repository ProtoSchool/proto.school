TODO vmx 2018-07-25: Explain that you need to use `tobBaseEncodedString()`

You already know the basics about adding nodes, making links and traversing them. Now it’s time to build something more useful. Within the next few lessons we’ll build a DAG that represents a blog.

There is already some code to get started with, some nodes are inserted. It’s two authors (Sam and Nat) and two blog posts about trees and computers.

### Task

Link authors to blog posts. Sam to trees, Nat to computers. To do this, add a new field called `author` to the blog posts which contains a link to the CID of the corresponding author. Return the CIDs of the two new blog posts as array.
