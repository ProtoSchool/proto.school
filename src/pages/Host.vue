        ProtoSchool is a community-driven effort and is 100% open source. This
        means that anyone can use the ProtoSchool materials and/or host an event.
        <p>
        <p class="f4 fw5 lh-copy ma0 pv3  ">
        Events are run independently by local <router-link to="/chapters">
        ProtoSchool chapters</router-link> around the world, but we ask that all
        events be not-for-profit (free or low-cost) and that governance of events
        have an open membership model (so that nobody can "control" the events).
        <p>
        <p class="f4 fw5 lh-copy ma0 pv3  ">
        ProtoSchool chapters also have an online presence to keep local
        communities interacting between events. Each chapter has its own
        GitHub repo within our organization, which makes it easy to manage a
        discussion board using GitHub issues and host a chapter website on our
        domain using GitHub Pages.
