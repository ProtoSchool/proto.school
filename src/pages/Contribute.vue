      ProtoSchool is a community-driven open source project dedicated to
      making it easy to get started with decentralized web technologies.
      We accomplish this by <strong>creating interactive tutorials</strong>
      and <strong>hosting community learning events</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2>Interactive Tutorials</h2>
      <p class="f4 fw5 lh-copy ma0 pv3">
      Our <router-link to="/tutorials">interactive tutorials</router-link> are
      the heart of our educational mission. Each browser-based tutorial
      consists of lessons of increasing difficulty, in which a new
      concept is explained and the learner is given a code challenge
      to solve to apply their learning. The learner submits their solution
      when ready, and receives contextual feedback if needed to try again.
      If their code passes, they move on to the next lesson in the tutorial.
      </p>

      <p class="f4 fw5 lh-copy ma0 pv3 ">
      For contributors <router-link to="/build">building new tutorials,</router-link>
      the process feels similar to creating a unit test suite
      which the learner must pass by implementing the correct code.
      </p>

      <h2>Topics</h2>
      <p class="f4 fw5 lh-copy ma0 pv3 ">
      ProtoSchool content is designed to introduce learners to the concepts,
      protocols, and tools that support the decentralized web. We're excited
      to add new tutorials to our collection, and we'd love your help building
      content about projects such as
      <a href="https://ipfs.io/" target="blank">IPFS</a>,
      <a href="https://ipld.io/" target="blank">IPLD</a>,
      <a href="https://libp2p.io/" target="blank">libp2p</a>,
      <a href="https://multiformats.io/" target="blank">Multiformats</a>,
      and more.
      </p>

      <h2>Chapter Events</h2>
      <p class="f4 fw5 lh-copy ma0 pv3 ">
      Community events around the world provide an opportunity for learners
      to explore ProtoSchool tutorials with guidance from mentors in their
      <router-link to="/chapters">local chapters</router-link>. Anyone can
      <router-link to="/host">host a ProtoSchool chapter</router-link>, and we
      provide tools and tips for managing local chapters and organizing events
      that are fun and welcoming for everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>Contributing</h2>
      <p class="f4 fw5 lh-copy ma0 pv3 ">
      ProtoSchool is a community-driven effort, and we depend on contributors
      to <router-link to="/host">build tutorials</router-link>,
      <router-link to="/host">organize chapter events</router-link>,
      improve our existing tutorials and documentation, and answer community
      questions. Learn more about

      <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
      <p class="f4 fw5 lh-copy ma0 pv3 ">
      We use GitHub to organize ProtoSchool. The best place to get in touch
      with questions about chapter leadership and community engagement is our
      <a href="https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing" target="blank">organizing
      repository</a>, where you can open a new issue and our organizers will be
      notified and respond. If you have a new tutorial idea or suggestions for
      improving the ProtoSchool website or curriculum, please open an issue in the
      <a href="https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io" target="blank">
      website repository</a>. For other issues, including Code of Conduct reports,
      please <a href="mailto:protoschool@protocol.ai">email the project maintainers</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
      <p class="f4 fw5 lh-copy ma0 pv3 ">
      We strive to make ProtoSchool a welcoming place for all community members.
      All community members, including chapter organizers, must abide by the
      <a href="https://github.com/protoschool/organizing/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">
      Code of Conduct</a> outlined in our organizing repository.
      </p>

      <p class="f4 fw5 lh-copy ma0 pv3 ">
      Additionally, each ProtoSchool chapter is responsible for maintaining
      their own Code of Conduct for chapter events and repos. If you have questions about the
      Code of Conduct for a specific chapter, you can open an issue in their
      associated GitHub repository.
